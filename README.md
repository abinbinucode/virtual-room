### Project Description
Cat Control Companion is an interactive virtual environment where users care for a digital cat by adjusting room settings, temperature, and interacting with the cat for fun responses. It‚Äôs designed as a humorous twist on virtual pets, focusing on quirky interactions and exaggerated management tasks for an absurdly over-engineered experience.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We realized people lack the ability to micro-manage a virtual cat‚Äôs living environment. From tweaking the temperature to appease a digital cat, our project fills this whimsical gap by allowing excessive control in a playful virtual room.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Cat Control Companion lets users adjust the room temperature, triggering unique reactions from the cat. With fun temperature controls, health reports, and interactive ‚Äúmeow‚Äù feedback, this project ensures you'll always have something to do with your virtual pet!
